# Metagross Instruction (stage=validate)

Review the captured evidence to ensure all deliverables are complete and validation gates have passed. Verify that the evidence block is correctly formatted and includes all necessary artifacts. Ensure that the documentation has been updated as per the requirements in `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/api_reference.md`, `docs/operations.md`, and `docs/SETUP.md`. Confirm that the test coverage exceeds the 85% target and that all tests are passing. Once verified, proceed to finalize the project.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
