# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Before proceeding to Phase 3: Webhook Processing, address the test database setup issues causing the 2 test failures and improve the test coverage to meet the 85% target. Ensure all tests pass and the coverage requirement is met before moving forward. Capture all evidence of successful test execution and coverage improvement in the `artifacts/` directory.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
