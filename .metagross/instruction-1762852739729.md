# Metagross Instruction (stage=validate)

Review the evidence provided, ensuring that all validation gates have been executed successfully. Verify that the test coverage has increased to 81% and that the core business logic is fully tested. Confirm that the known limitations do not block deployment and that the project meets the Metagross execution contract. If all criteria are satisfied, prepare to move to the final validation stage.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
