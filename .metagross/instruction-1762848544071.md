# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Reflection backlog items remain unresolved. Implement the following before returning to validation:

1. Raise implementation completeness to 100% (currently 75%). Address every missing requirement identified by reflection.
2. Resolve critical gap: Test coverage at 62% falls below specification targets (≥85% unit, ≥70% integration)
3. Resolve critical gap: Performance testing not executed - p95 latency targets (<100ms) not verified
4. Resolve critical gap: 12 test failures reported in SPEC_COMPLIANCE.md indicating test infrastructure issues
5. Follow-up from reflection: Project is functionally complete with all core APIs, webhooks, database schema, reconciliation, and documentation implemented. Core business logic (entitlements engine) has 80% test coverage. However, overall test coverage at 62% is below specification targets. Performance testing has not been executed to verify <100ms p95 latency targets. Test infrastructure issues prevent full test execution. Recommended next steps: 1) Fix test infrastructure to resolve 12 failing tests, 2) Increase test coverage to meet ≥85% unit and ≥70% integration targets, 3) Execute load testing to verify performance requirements, 4) Address any edge cases identified during testing. The system is production-ready for core use cases but requires test coverage improvements before full production deployment.

After addressing these items, run inside Docker/Compose:
- `docker compose build`
- `make lint`
- `make typecheck`
- `make test`

Capture the resulting logs under `artifacts/` and provide an updated evidence block showing the new test results and coverage.
