# Metagross Instruction

Create the `docs/api_reference.md` file to document the API endpoints for the centralized billing and entitlements platform. This document should include detailed information about each endpoint, such as the HTTP method, URL, request parameters, response format, and any relevant notes or examples. Ensure the documentation is clear and comprehensive to facilitate integration by other developers. Once completed, verify that the file is correctly formatted and integrated into the documentation build process.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
