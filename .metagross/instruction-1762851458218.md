# Metagross Instruction (stage=plan)

# Resume Orientation with Project Audit
You are resuming an in-progress build. Before modifying code you MUST:

1. Re-read ALL project documentation and artifacts to refresh context:
- /home/brad/cursor_code/metagross_projects/stripe/docs
   - Also review: TODOs, roadmaps, defects, test results, open issues, artifacts/

2. Perform a comprehensive PROJECT AUDIT by answering:

   **A. Project Identity:**
   - What is this project? What does it do?
   - Why does it exist? What problem does it solve?
   - Who are the users/stakeholders?

   **B. Current State (Be Brutally Honest):**
   - What IS working? (cite actual test evidence, not assumptions)
   - What is NOT working? (failed tests, missing features, bugs)
   - What is MISSING? (features, tests, docs, config)

   **C. Critical Assessment (Roast the Project):**
   - What are the weak points? (architecture, code quality, test coverage)
   - What are the technical debt items?
   - What would you improve if starting fresh?

   **D. Blockers & Configuration:**
   - Are there any CRITICAL blockers preventing deployment?
   - What configuration is missing or incorrect?
   - What needs to be done before this can ship?

3. Produce a status report with ALL of these sections:
   - **Project Summary**: Identity and purpose (from audit A)
   - **Current State**: What works, what doesn't (from audit B)
   - **Critical Issues**: Blockers and missing config (from audit D)
   - **Improvement Opportunities**: Weaknesses and debt (from audit C)
   - **Plan of Attack**: Ordered TODO checklist prioritizing critical issues

4. Incorporate the reflection backlog items below into your assessment:
1. Confirm no outstanding gaps remain; if any are discovered, list them explicitly.

Do NOT run builds or modify files during this orientation step. Respond only with the comprehensive audit and status report.

**Goal:** Provide an honest, actionable assessment that guides the next phase of development.
