# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Proceed to Phase 3: Webhook Processing. Implement idempotent webhook ingestion and event processors. Ensure that all webhook handlers are idempotent and do not cause destructive changes. Update the documentation to reflect any changes in APIs or operational flows. Capture all evidence of successful implementation and testing in the `artifacts/` directory.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
