# Metagross Instruction

Create the `pyproject.toml` file to define the project structure, dependencies, and configurations for the centralized billing and entitlements platform. This file will be used by Poetry to manage the project's dependencies and environment.

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "centralized-billing-platform"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A centralized billing and entitlements platform integrating with Stripe Billing."
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
license = "MIT"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"
fastapi = "^0.68.0"
uvicorn = "^0.15.0"
psycopg2-binary = "^2.9.1"
redis = "^4.0.2"
stripe = "^2.60.0"
pydantic = "^1.8.2"
httpx = "^0.19.0"
structlog = "^21.1.0"

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
pytest = "^6.2.4"
pytest-cov = "^2.12.1"
mypy = "^0.910"
ruff = "^0.0.1"
bandit = "^1.7.0"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

This `pyproject.toml` file sets up the project with necessary dependencies for FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Stripe, and development tools like pytest, mypy, ruff, and bandit. It ensures that the project is ready for further development and integration with Docker.

**Evidence of Completion:**
- The `pyproject.toml` file is created with the specified dependencies and configurations.
- This file will be used in subsequent steps to install dependencies and set up the project environment within Docker containers.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
