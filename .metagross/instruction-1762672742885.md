# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Reflection review flagged outstanding work. Address the following items:
- Completion is at 95%. Raise to 100% by finishing outstanding requirements.
- Critical gap: Reconciliation system lacks automated scheduling - spec requires scheduled reconciliation but implementation only provides manual execution via cron (no built-in scheduler like Celery or background task runner)
- Notes: Project is production-ready with all core functional requirements implemented. All 53 tests passing with 89.66% coverage (exceeds 85% requirement). All required webhook event types handled with idempotent processing. Entitlement computation from subscriptions, purchases, and manual grants fully implemented with cache invalidation. API key authentication with project scoping operational. Documentation complete (architecture, API reference, operations, SETUP). Build, lint, and typecheck all passing. Only gap: reconciliation requires external cron setup rather than built-in scheduling. Recommended next steps: 1) Add scheduled reconciliation job (Celery or APScheduler) for automated daily runs, 2) Consider minor API response consistency improvements (metrics endpoint field names), 3) Production deployment with external cron acceptable for v1 release.

After completing these tasks, rerun docker compose build, lint, typecheck, and tests, then provide updated evidence.
