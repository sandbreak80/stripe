# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Proceed with Phase 1: Database Schema & Models. Implement SQLAlchemy models for all entities (Project, Product, Price, Subscription, Purchase, ManualGrant, Entitlement) and create the initial Alembic migration. Ensure all models are idempotent and align with the execution contract. Capture evidence of the implementation process, including model definitions and migration scripts, and store them in the 'artifacts/' directory.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
