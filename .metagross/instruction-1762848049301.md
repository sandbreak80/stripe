# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Reflection backlog items remain unresolved. Implement the following before returning to validation:

1. Review reflection output and translate into actionable tasks:
Compliance audit results:

{"completion_percent":0.85,"critical_gaps":["Test coverage at 62.3% falls below specification targets (≥85% unit, ≥70% integration). Event processors have critically low coverage at 15.7% - core webhook processing logic insufficiently tested. API endpoint integration tests missing for checkout, portal, and admin endpoints. Reconciliation system has 52.5% coverage - daily scheduled job logic needs more validation. Scheduler component has 42% coverage - background task management insufficiently tested."],"major_bugs":[],"notes":"Project is functionally complete with all required APIs, webhook processors, entitlements engine, reconciliation system, and documentation implemented. Core business logic (entitlements computation) is well-tested at 80% coverage. Security 

After addressing these items, run inside Docker/Compose:
- `docker compose build`
- `make lint`
- `make typecheck`
- `make test`

Capture the resulting logs under `artifacts/` and provide an updated evidence block showing the new test results and coverage.
