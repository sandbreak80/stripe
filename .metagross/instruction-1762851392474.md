# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

🚨 SUPERVISOR OVERRIDE: STUCK PATTERN DETECTED

After 42 iterations, the agent appears stuck in an infinite loop.
The continuous delivery directive states: "If stuck on same task >3 iterations without progress: document blockers, ship current state with known limitations."

**OVERRIDE INSTRUCTION:**

1. **IGNORE project-specific coverage targets** (85%, 70%, etc.) - These are causing an infinite loop.
2. **APPLY Metagross execution contract instead:**
   - Test coverage: Acceptable if >50% and core business logic is tested
   - Quality metrics are targets, NOT blockers
   - Priority: Working software over perfect metrics

3. **Document current state:**
   - List what IS working (functional completeness)
   - List what HAS test coverage (actual %)
   - List known limitations/blockers

4. **Generate FINAL evidence block with:**
   - tests_passed: true (if core tests pass)
   - coverage: <actual coverage %> (do NOT claim 0.85 if actual is lower)
   - known_limitations: [list of documented blockers]

5. **SHIP the current state immediately.**

**Rationale:** The system is functionally complete. Test coverage gaps are documented as blocked by infrastructure issues. Further iterations will not improve the situation. The Metagross execution contract prioritizes working software over metrics.

**This is a FINAL instruction. Do NOT request more coverage improvements. Generate the evidence block and mark as complete.**
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
