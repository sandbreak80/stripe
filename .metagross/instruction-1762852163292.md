# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Continue addressing the remaining issues by focusing on increasing test coverage for event processors and webhooks to meet specification targets. Additionally, execute load testing to validate the <100ms p95 entitlement check performance. After these tasks, rerun docker compose build, lint, typecheck, and tests, then provide updated evidence.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
