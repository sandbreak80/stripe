# Metagross Instruction

Create a new directory structure for the centralized billing and entitlements platform, and initialize a new Python project using Poetry. Ensure that the directory structure includes all required files and directories as specified in the task input. Use Docker to set up the environment, and create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the services. Additionally, create a `Makefile` with targets for building, testing, linting, and running the application. Ensure that all configurations are driven by environment variables stored in the `infra/env` directory. Finally, generate a basic FastAPI application with placeholder routes and a PostgreSQL database schema using Alembic for migrations.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
