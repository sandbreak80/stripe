# Metagross Instruction (stage=validate)

Review the implementation of the critical event processors and ensure that all evidence requirements are met. Specifically, verify that the evidence block is correctly formatted and includes all necessary details such as test results, coverage, and artifacts. Ensure that the evidence is stored in the 'artifacts/' directory and that all validation gates pass, including 'docker compose build', 'make lint', 'make typecheck', and 'make test'.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
