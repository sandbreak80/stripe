# Metagross Instruction

Create the `services/api/Dockerfile` to define the Docker image for the FastAPI service. This file should use a multi-stage build to ensure a clean and efficient image, leveraging `python:3.11-slim` as the base image. Ensure that the Dockerfile is configured to install dependencies using `poetry`, and set up the application to run with a non-root user for security. Include health checks and ensure the image is idempotent and reproducible.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
