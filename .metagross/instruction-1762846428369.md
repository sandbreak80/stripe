# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Proceed with Phase 3.2: Event Processing Infrastructure. Implement event deduplication and the event router/dispatcher. Ensure that the event deduplication mechanism is idempotent and aligns with the execution contract. Capture evidence of the implementation process, including module and function creation, and store them in the 'artifacts/' directory.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
