# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Reflection backlog items remain unresolved. Implement the following before returning to validation:

1. Raise implementation completeness to 100% (currently 75%). Address every missing requirement identified by reflection.
2. Resolve critical gap: Test coverage below specification targets: 54.4% overall vs ≥85% unit and ≥70% integration requirements. Critical components have low coverage (reconciliation: 14%, event_processors: 16%, webhook_verification: 30%)
3. Resolve critical gap: Prometheus metrics not implemented despite dependency being present. Specification requires Prometheus metrics for operational monitoring but only business metrics endpoint exists
4. Resolve critical gap: 13 integration tests failing due to async/mocking infrastructure issues, preventing full validation of API endpoints
5. Follow-up from reflection: Project is functionally complete with all core APIs, webhook processing, reconciliation, and documentation implemented. Core business logic (entitlements engine) has 80% test coverage providing production confidence. However, overall test coverage (54.4%) falls significantly below specification targets (≥85% unit, ≥70% integration). Prometheus metrics export is missing. Recommended next steps: (1) Increase test coverage for reconciliation and event processors to meet spec targets, (2) Implement Prometheus metrics endpoint, (3) Fix test infrastructure issues to enable full test execution, (4) Conduct load testing to verify <100ms p95 latency target for entitlement checks. Project is production-ready for core use cases but requires test coverage improvements before full production deployment.

After addressing these items, run inside Docker/Compose:
- `docker compose build`
- `make lint`
- `make typecheck`
- `make test`

Capture the resulting logs under `artifacts/` and provide an updated evidence block showing the new test results and coverage.
