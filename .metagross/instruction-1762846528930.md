# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Proceed with Phase 3.3: Critical Event Processors. Implement processors for the 5 critical Stripe events: `checkout.session.completed`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, and `charge.refunded`. Ensure each processor is idempotent and integrates with the existing event processing infrastructure. Capture evidence of the implementation process, including module and function creation, and store them in the 'artifacts/' directory.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
