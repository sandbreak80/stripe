# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Proceed to Phase 2: Core Payment Flows. Begin by integrating Stripe for customer creation, checkout sessions, and portal sessions. Implement the API endpoints POST `/checkout/session` and POST `/portal/session`. Ensure that the Stripe integration is tested using Stripe's test mode. Update the Makefile to include any new commands necessary for testing these integrations. Capture all evidence of successful integration and testing in the `artifacts/` directory.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
