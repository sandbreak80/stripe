# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Reflection backlog items remain unresolved. Implement the following before returning to validation:

1. Raise implementation completeness to 100% (currently 92%). Address every missing requirement identified by reflection.
2. Resolve critical gap: Test coverage at 62% overall falls below specification targets (≥85% unit, ≥70% integration) - core entitlements logic at 80% coverage is production-ready, but event processors (15.7%), webhook endpoint (33.3%), and reconciliation (52.5%) need additional tests
3. Resolve critical gap: Performance testing not executed - Redis caching implemented but p95 latency target (<100ms) not verified under load
4. Resolve critical gap: Test infrastructure issues preventing full test execution - 12 tests failing due to async/mocking problems, though core functionality validated
5. Follow-up from reflection: Project is functionally complete with all core APIs, webhooks, entitlements computation, reconciliation, and admin endpoints implemented. Database schema complete with migrations. Docker containerization ready. All documentation present (architecture, API reference, operations, setup). Security measures in place (API key auth, webhook verification). Core business logic well-tested (80% coverage for entitlements engine). Test coverage below spec targets but exceeds 50% minimum. No critical bugs identified. Recommendation: APPROVE for production deployment with understanding that test coverage improvements and performance testing should be prioritized in first post-launch iteration. Estimated 92% completion - production-ready for core use cases with incremental improvements needed.

After addressing these items, run inside Docker/Compose:
- `docker compose build`
- `make lint`
- `make typecheck`
- `make test`

Capture the resulting logs under `artifacts/` and provide an updated evidence block showing the new test results and coverage.
