# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Reflection backlog items remain unresolved. Implement the following before returning to validation:

1. Raise implementation completeness to 100% (currently 95%). Address every missing requirement identified by reflection.
2. Resolve critical gap: Reconciliation system lacks automated scheduling - spec requires scheduled reconciliation but implementation only provides manual execution via cron (no built-in scheduler like Celery or background task runner)
3. Follow-up from reflection: Project is production-ready with all core functional requirements implemented. All 53 tests passing with 89.66% coverage (exceeds 85% requirement). All required webhook event types handled with idempotent processing. Entitlement computation from subscriptions, purchases, and manual grants fully implemented with cache invalidation. API key authentication with project scoping operational. Documentation complete (architecture, API reference, operations, SETUP). Build, lint, and typecheck all passing. Only gap: reconciliation requires external cron setup rather than built-in scheduling. Recommended next steps: 1) Add scheduled reconciliation job (Celery or APScheduler) for automated daily runs, 2) Consider minor API response consistency improvements (metrics endpoint field names), 3) Production deployment with external cron acceptable for v1 release.

After addressing these items, run inside Docker/Compose:
- `docker compose build`
- `make lint`
- `make typecheck`
- `make test`

Capture the resulting logs under `artifacts/` and provide an updated evidence block showing the new test results and coverage.
