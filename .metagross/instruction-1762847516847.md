# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Reflection backlog items remain unresolved. Implement the following before returning to validation:

1. Raise implementation completeness to 100% (currently 95%). Address every missing requirement identified by reflection.
2. Resolve critical gap: Test coverage metrics not verified - spec requires ≥85% unit test coverage and ≥70% integration test coverage, but actual coverage percentage not confirmed in artifacts
3. Resolve critical gap: SPEC_COMPLIANCE.md referenced in audit request but not found in docs/ directory - compliance documentation may be incomplete
4. Follow-up from reflection: Implementation review shows comprehensive feature completion: all core APIs (checkout, entitlements, portal, webhooks, admin), database schema, event processors (5 Stripe events), reconciliation system with scheduler, caching, authentication, and webhook verification are implemented. Documentation (README, SETUP, architecture, API reference, operations) is complete. Code structure is sound with proper error handling. Remaining work: verify test coverage meets spec requirements (≥85% unit, ≥70% integration) by running test suite and reviewing coverage reports, and create SPEC_COMPLIANCE.md if required. Project appears production-ready pending coverage verification.

After addressing these items, run inside Docker/Compose:
- `docker compose build`
- `make lint`
- `make typecheck`
- `make test`

Capture the resulting logs under `artifacts/` and provide an updated evidence block showing the new test results and coverage.
