# Metagross Instruction

Create the `pyproject.toml` file to define the project structure, dependencies, and configurations for the centralized billing and entitlements platform. This file will be used by Poetry to manage the project's dependencies and environment.

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "centralized-billing-platform"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A centralized billing and entitlements platform integrating with Stripe Billing."
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
license = "MIT"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"
fastapi = "^0.78.0"
uvicorn = "^0.17.0"
pydantic = "^1.9.0"
requests = "^2.27.1"
psycopg2-binary = "^2.9.3"
redis = "^4.1.0"
stripe = "^2.64.0"
structlog = "^21.5.0"

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
pytest = "^7.1.2"
pytest-cov = "^3.0.0"
mypy = "^0.961"
ruff = "^0.0.1"
bandit = "^1.7.0"
httpx = "^0.23.0"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

This `pyproject.toml` file includes the necessary dependencies for the FastAPI application, PostgreSQL, Redis, Stripe integration, and development tools for testing, linting, and type checking.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
