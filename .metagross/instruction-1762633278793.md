# Metagross Instruction

Create the `infra/database/seed_data.sql` file with initial seed data for the PostgreSQL database, ensuring it includes entries for projects, users, products, prices, subscriptions, and entitlements. This will help in setting up the database with necessary initial data for testing and development purposes.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
