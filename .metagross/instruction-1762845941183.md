# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Proceed with Phase 0: Project Setup & Infrastructure. Begin by creating the project directory structure and setting up the Docker environment. Ensure all configurations align with the execution contract, particularly the use of Docker/Compose/Make for all operations. Capture evidence of the setup process, including Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml configurations, and store them in the 'artifacts/' directory.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
