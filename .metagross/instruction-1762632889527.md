# Metagross Instruction

Create the `infra/migrations/0001_initial.sql` file to define the initial database schema for the centralized billing and entitlements platform. This schema should include tables for `projects`, `users`, `products`, `prices`, `subscriptions`, and `entitlements`. Ensure that the SQL script is idempotent and can be safely re-run without causing errors. After creating the file, verify its correctness by running the migration inside the Docker container and capturing the logs as evidence.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
