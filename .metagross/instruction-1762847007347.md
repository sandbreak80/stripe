# Metagross Instruction (stage=validate)

Proceed to update the documentation files (architecture.md, api_reference.md, operations.md, SETUP.md) as per the execution contract. Ensure that all changes made to the codebase are accurately reflected in the documentation. After updating the documentation, re-run all validation gates, including 'docker compose build', 'make lint', 'make typecheck', and 'make test', to ensure everything is in order. Capture and store all evidence in the 'artifacts/' directory.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
