# Metagross Instruction

Create the `services/worker/Dockerfile` to define the Docker image for the worker service. This Dockerfile should use a multi-stage build to ensure a clean and efficient image, leveraging the `python:3.11-slim` base image. Ensure that the Dockerfile installs necessary dependencies using `poetry` and sets up the environment for running the worker tasks and webhooks. Include health checks and ensure the image runs as a non-root user for security purposes.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
