# Metagross Instruction

Create the `pyproject.toml` file to define the project dependencies and configuration for the centralized billing and entitlements platform. This file will be used by Poetry to manage the project's dependencies and environment.

### Instruction:
1. Create a `pyproject.toml` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Define the project metadata, including the name, version, and description.
3. Specify the Python version required for the project.
4. List the dependencies required for the project, including FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Redis, and any other necessary libraries.
5. Include development dependencies for testing, linting, and type checking, such as pytest, mypy, and ruff.
6. Configure the build system to use Poetry.

### Example `pyproject.toml` Content:
```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "centralized-billing-entitlements"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A centralized billing and entitlements platform integrating with Stripe."
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
license = "MIT"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"
fastapi = "^0.78.0"
uvicorn = "^0.17.0"
sqlalchemy = "^1.4.0"
psycopg2-binary = "^2.9.0"
redis = "^4.0.0"
pydantic = "^1.9.0"
httpx = "^0.23.0"
stripe = "^2.0.0"

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
pytest = "^7.0.0"
pytest-cov = "^3.0.0"
mypy = "^0.950"
ruff = "^0.0.1"
black = "^22.3.0"
bandit = "^1.7.0"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

### Execution:
- Use Docker to run the following command to ensure the `pyproject.toml` is correctly set up and dependencies are resolved:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app python:3.11-slim bash -c "pip install poetry && poetry install"
  ```

### Evidence:
- Capture the output of the `poetry install` command to verify that all dependencies
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
