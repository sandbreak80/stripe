# Metagross Instruction

Create the `sdk/python/billing_client.py` file to implement a Python SDK client that wraps the API endpoints for the centralized billing and entitlements platform. This client should handle API requests, retries, and error handling, and should be designed to be easily integrated into Python micro-services. Ensure the client is well-documented and includes methods for interacting with the checkout session, entitlements, and customer portal endpoints. Use environment variables for configuration and ensure the client is compatible with the FastAPI service.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
