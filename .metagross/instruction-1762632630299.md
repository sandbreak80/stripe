# Metagross Instruction

Create the `infra/env/dev.env` and `infra/env/test.env` files with the necessary environment variables for development and testing, ensuring they are configured for use with Docker and do not contain any sensitive information. These files should include placeholders for variables such as `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `STRIPE_API_KEY`, and any other configuration needed for the application to run in development and test environments.

```bash
# infra/env/dev.env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/dev_db
REDIS_URL=redis://cache:6379/0
STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_HERE
# Add other necessary environment variables here

# infra/env/test.env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/test_db
REDIS_URL=redis://cache:6379/1
STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_HERE
# Add other necessary environment variables here
```

### Execution Steps:
1. Create the `infra/env/dev.env` file with the specified environment variables.
2. Create the `infra/env/test.env` file with the specified environment variables.

### Evidence:
- Ensure that the files are created and contain the correct placeholders.
- Verify that no sensitive information is included in the files.
- Confirm that the files are correctly referenced in the Docker Compose configuration for the respective environments.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
