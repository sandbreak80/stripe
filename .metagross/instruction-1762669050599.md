# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Focus on increasing test coverage to meet the 85% target and fix the failing tests, particularly for the portal session and webhook processors. Ensure that the reconciliation system has adequate test coverage. Once these issues are resolved, rerun docker compose build, make lint, make typecheck, and make test to verify that all validation gates pass. Capture the logs and evidence in the artifacts directory.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
