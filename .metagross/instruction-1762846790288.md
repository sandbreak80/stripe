# Metagross Instruction (stage=validate)

Proceed to implement the test suite as part of Phase 4: Entitlements Engine + Tests. Ensure that the test suite covers critical business logic and achieves a minimum coverage of 65%. Address the type checking warnings by adding type ignores or SQLAlchemy stubs where necessary. Update the documentation files (`docs/architecture.md`, `docs/api_reference.md`, `docs/operations.md`, `docs/SETUP.md`) as per the execution contract. Capture and store all evidence in the 'artifacts/' directory, and ensure all validation gates pass, including 'docker compose build', 'make lint', 'make typecheck', and 'make test'.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
