# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Begin with Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure. Start by creating the project structure with directories for source code, tests, Docker configurations, and documentation. Then, create the `.cursorrules` file at the repository root with the execution contract details. After that, proceed to create the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for the application, PostgreSQL, and Redis services. Finally, set up the `Makefile` with targets for building, linting, typechecking, testing, and managing the Docker environment.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
