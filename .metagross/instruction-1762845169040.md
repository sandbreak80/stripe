# Metagross Instruction (stage=plan)

# Planning Phase Instruction
Before making any code changes you MUST perform the following steps:

1. Read all project documentation thoroughly. Prioritise the following directories:
- /home/brad/cursor_code/metagross_projects/stripe/docs
   - Also review the execution contract stored in `.cursorrules` at the repo root.

2. Produce a concise response with ALL of these sections:
   - **Summary**: Key goals, architecture highlights, critical constraints.
   - **Development Plan**: Ordered set of phases with milestones.
   - **TODO Board**: A numbered checklist of implementation tasks.
   - **Open Questions / Risks**: Anything needing clarification or watch-outs.

3. Do NOT modify code, run tests, or create files in this iteration. Planning only.
4. Cite specific documents when referencing requirements to prove you read them.
5. Confirm you understand the execution contract (Docker-only, mandatory test gates, evidence block).

Return only the structured planning response. After this the supervisor will issue further guidance.
