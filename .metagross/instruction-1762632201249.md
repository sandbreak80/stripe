# Metagross Instruction

Create the `infra/docker-compose.yml` file to define the Docker Compose configuration for the centralized billing and entitlements platform. This file should include services for the API, worker, PostgreSQL, and Redis, with appropriate configurations for each service, including environment variables, volumes, and network settings. Ensure that the configuration supports the development and testing environments, and includes health checks for the API and worker services.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
