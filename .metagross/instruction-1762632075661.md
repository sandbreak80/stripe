# Metagross Instruction

Create the `pyproject.toml` file with the necessary configurations for the project, including dependencies for FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Stripe integration. This file will also configure the use of Poetry for dependency management and specify the Python version.

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "centralized-billing-entitlements"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A centralized billing and entitlements platform integrating with Stripe."
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
license = "MIT"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"
fastapi = "^0.70.0"
uvicorn = "^0.15.0"
psycopg2-binary = "^2.9.1"
redis = "^4.0.2"
stripe = "^2.60.0"
pydantic = "^1.8.2"
httpx = "^0.21.0"
structlog = "^21.1.0"

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
pytest = "^6.2.5"
pytest-cov = "^2.12.1"
mypy = "^0.910"
ruff = "^0.0.1"
bandit = "^1.7.0"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

After creating the `pyproject.toml`, run the following command inside the Docker container to install the dependencies and generate the `poetry.lock` file:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app python:3.11-slim bash -c "pip install poetry && poetry install"
```

**Evidence of Completion:**
- `pyproject.toml` file created with specified dependencies.
- `poetry.lock` file generated after running the Poetry install command inside Docker.
- Ensure no errors occur during the installation process.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
