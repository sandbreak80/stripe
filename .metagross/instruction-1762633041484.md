# Metagross Instruction

Create the `docs/SETUP.md` file to provide detailed instructions for setting up the development environment for the Centralized Billing & Entitlements Service. This document should include steps for installing Docker, running the Docker Compose stack, and verifying the setup with health checks. Ensure the instructions are clear and concise, and include any necessary prerequisites or configurations.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
