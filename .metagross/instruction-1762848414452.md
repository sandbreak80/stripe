# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Reflection backlog items remain unresolved. Implement the following before returning to validation:

1. Raise implementation completeness to 100% (currently 85%). Address every missing requirement identified by reflection.
2. Resolve critical gap: Test coverage below specification targets: 62% overall vs ≥85% unit and ≥70% integration targets specified in docs/README.md
3. Resolve critical gap: Performance testing not executed: No load testing to verify <100ms p95 latency target for entitlement checks
4. Resolve critical gap: 12 tests failing due to async/mocking infrastructure issues preventing full test execution
5. Follow-up from reflection: Project is functionally complete with all core APIs, webhooks, entitlements computation, reconciliation, and documentation implemented. All required endpoints operational: checkout, entitlements, portal, webhooks, admin (grant/revoke/reconcile), metrics, and health checks. Database schema complete with migrations. Security measures in place (API key hashing, webhook verification). Docker containerization ready. Core business logic (entitlements.py) has 80% test coverage. However, overall test coverage at 62% falls below specification targets (≥85% unit, ≥70% integration), and performance targets remain unverified. Recommended next steps: 1) Fix failing test infrastructure (async/mocking), 2) Increase test coverage to meet spec targets, 3) Execute load testing to verify performance SLOs, 4) Conduct security audit before production deployment.

After addressing these items, run inside Docker/Compose:
- `docker compose build`
- `make lint`
- `make typecheck`
- `make test`

Capture the resulting logs under `artifacts/` and provide an updated evidence block showing the new test results and coverage.
