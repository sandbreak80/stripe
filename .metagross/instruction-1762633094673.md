# Metagross Instruction

Create the `docs/architecture.md` file to document the architecture of the centralized billing and entitlements platform. This document should include an overview of the system architecture, key components, data flow, and any relevant diagrams. Ensure the document is clear and comprehensive, providing enough detail for developers and stakeholders to understand the system's structure and interactions. Once completed, commit the file to the repository.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
