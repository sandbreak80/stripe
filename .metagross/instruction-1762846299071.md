# Metagross Instruction (stage=plan)

Before proceeding to Phase 3: Stripe Integration, we need to ensure that the planning for this phase is complete. Specifically, outline the tasks required to enhance the Stripe service with webhook signature verification and error handling. Include details on how these tasks will be implemented in a Docker/Compose/Make context, ensuring idempotency and alignment with the execution contract. Once the plan is detailed, we can proceed with implementation.
