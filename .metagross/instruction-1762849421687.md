# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Reflection backlog items remain unresolved. Implement the following before returning to validation:

1. Raise implementation completeness to 100% (currently 87%). Address every missing requirement identified by reflection.
2. Resolve critical gap: Test coverage at 67.3% falls below specification targets (≥85% unit, ≥70% integration). Core entitlements logic meets target at 80%, but webhooks.py (33.3%) and event_processors.py (35.5%) need additional coverage.
3. Resolve critical gap: 18 tests failing due to test infrastructure issues (async/mocking). Per directive these are non-blocking, but prevent full validation.
4. Resolve critical gap: Performance testing not executed - <100ms p95 latency target for entitlement checks not verified under load.
5. Follow-up from reflection: All functional requirements implemented: checkout, entitlements, portal, webhooks (5 event types), admin (grant/revoke/reconcile), metrics, and reconciliation scheduler. Database schema complete with migrations. Security measures in place (webhook verification, API key hashing, audit trails). Documentation complete. Docker containerization ready. Core business logic well-tested (80% coverage). Production-ready for core use cases. Recommended next steps: increase test coverage for webhook endpoint and event processors, fix test infrastructure to enable full test execution, execute load testing to verify performance targets, then proceed to production deployment.

After addressing these items, run inside Docker/Compose:
- `docker compose build`
- `make lint`
- `make typecheck`
- `make test`

Capture the resulting logs under `artifacts/` and provide an updated evidence block showing the new test results and coverage.
