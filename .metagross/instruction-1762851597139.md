# Metagross Instruction (stage=validate)

Review the evidence provided for the Phase 1 pre-launch improvements. Ensure that all changes were made within Docker/Compose/Make contexts and are idempotent. Verify that the validation gates passed, and confirm that the documented limitations are acceptable per the execution contract. If everything is in order, prepare for deployment and plan for post-launch improvements.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
