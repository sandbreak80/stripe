# Metagross Instruction

Create the `artifacts/README.md` file to document where logs and reports are stored. This file should include details on the location of build logs, test results, and any other relevant artifacts generated during the development and testing process. Ensure the documentation is clear and concise, providing paths relative to the project root and any necessary instructions for accessing these artifacts.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
