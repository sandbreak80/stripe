# Metagross Instruction (stage=plan)

# Resume Orientation
You are resuming an in-progress build. Before modifying code you MUST:

1. Re-read the following documentation and specs to refresh context:
- /home/brad/cursor_code/metagross_projects/stripe/docs

2. Produce a concise update with ALL of these sections (no file edits yet):
   - **Project Status**: What is already implemented, referencing specific docs/files.
   - **Outstanding Requirements**: Enumerate concrete tasks that remain. Tie each item to docs/spec sections.
   - **Plan of Attack**: Ordered TODO checklist for the next coding iterations.
   - **Risks / Questions**: Anything blocking execution.

3. Incorporate the reflection backlog items below into your assessment:
1. Confirm no outstanding gaps remain; if any are discovered, list them explicitly.

Do NOT run builds or modify files during this orientation step. Respond only with the analysis.
