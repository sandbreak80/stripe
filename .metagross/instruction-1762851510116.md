# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Proceed with implementing the pre-launch improvements as outlined in the Plan of Attack. Focus on creating the `.env.example` file, fixing the Purchase model `valid_from` initialization bug, resolving the admin API test assertion bug, removing hardcoded Stripe keys from `docker-compose.yml`, and documenting performance testing procedures. Ensure all changes are made within Docker/Compose/Make contexts and are idempotent. After completing these tasks, provide evidence of the changes and their successful execution.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
