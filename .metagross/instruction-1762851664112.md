# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Reflection review flagged outstanding work. Address the following items:
- Completion is at 82%. Raise to 100% by finishing outstanding requirements.
- Critical gap: Test coverage at 67.3% falls below specification requirement of ≥85% unit and ≥70% integration coverage
- Critical gap: Performance validation missing: <100ms p95 entitlement check SLA not verified under load
- Critical gap: Test infrastructure issues: 18 failing tests prevent full validation of event processors and webhook endpoints
- Major bug: 18 failing tests indicate potential async/mocking infrastructure issues that block comprehensive test execution
- Notes: Project is functionally complete with all core APIs, webhook processors, reconciliation scheduler, and documentation implemented. Core entitlements logic achieves 80% test coverage. However, overall test coverage (67.3%) and performance validation do not meet specification gates. Test infrastructure needs stabilization to enable full validation. Recommended next steps: (1) Fix test infrastructure to resolve 18 failing tests, (2) Increase test coverage for event_processors (35.5%) and webhooks (33.3%) to meet spec targets, (3) Execute load testing to validate <100ms p95 entitlement check performance, (4) Address linting (96 errors) and type checking (30 errors) as part of CI hardening. Project is production-ready for core use cases but requires test coverage and performance validation improvements before full production deployment.

After completing these tasks, rerun docker compose build, lint, typecheck, and tests, then provide updated evidence.
