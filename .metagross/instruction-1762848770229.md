# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Reflection backlog items remain unresolved. Implement the following before returning to validation:

1. Raise implementation completeness to 100% (currently 87%). Address every missing requirement identified by reflection.
2. Follow-up from reflection: Implementation is functionally complete with all required APIs, webhook processors, database models, entitlements computation, reconciliation system, and Docker containerization in place. Test coverage is 67.3% (exceeds 50% minimum but below spec target of ≥85% unit/≥70% integration). Core business logic (entitlements.py) achieves 80% coverage. Code quality issues exist (96 linting errors, 30 type checking errors) but are non-blocking. Performance testing not executed. All documentation complete. System is production-ready for core use cases. Recommended next steps: increase test coverage for event processors and reconciliation, execute load testing, fix linting/type errors, and address test infrastructure issues for comprehensive test execution.

After addressing these items, run inside Docker/Compose:
- `docker compose build`
- `make lint`
- `make typecheck`
- `make test`

Capture the resulting logs under `artifacts/` and provide an updated evidence block showing the new test results and coverage.
